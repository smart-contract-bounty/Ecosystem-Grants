## :wave: Introduction
Ecosystem Grants are part of the **ink!ubator**, a holistic bounty program with the goal of furthering the ink! smart contracting ecosystem. This bounty program is funded by the Polkadot treasury with the support of the community.

The bounty includes Curators from the following Polkadot ecosystem teams:
- [Astar Network](https://astar.network/)
- [Parity](https://www.parity.io/)
- [Phala Network](https://www.phala.network/en/)
- [Brushfam](https://brushfam.io/)
- [Aleph Zero](https://alephzero.org/)

The Ecosystem Grants focus on funding projects which will demonstrate the potential of ink! and well as those which push the ink! ecosystem forward, such as infrastructure projects or developer tooling.

The Ecosystem Grants are only one aspect of the ink!ubator. For more details on the rest of the initiative see the [Polkadot Treasury Bounty Proposal](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/bounty/19).

### Guidelines

Anyone is welcome to apply for a grant. This program funds projects that are dedicated to ink! ecosystem growth. We focus on strong technical ideas that contribute to ink! infrastructure, demonstate ink! potential, and unveil applicable business side thus growing the ecosystem. 

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:
- It clearly shows the advantage of ink! over other smart contract languages (e.g. Solidity)
- Your idea is innovative and contributes to the general growth of web3, Polkadot and ink! ecosystem. We would usually prefer innovation over duplication of what already exist on EVM.
- It presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work.
- You can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant if applicable.
- Your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms.
- Your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a token sale.
- Applications must not mention a specific token. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the software that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant, and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to finish a grant before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we do not fund projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering or criminal activities in general.

We require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognised for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery **will lead to immediate termination**. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

### Project Ideas
The main acceptance criteria of any submitted project would be its impact on the ink! ecosystem.

We would like to advise 3 following categories:

**Canary Dapp**

A Canary Dapp is a full-stack application which _could_ be deployed on to a value bearing network, but may not necessarily be battle hardened enough for serious use cases. They are meant to be a step beyond simple tutorials while still being self-contained enough to provide a useful reference for developers building production grade dApps.

Some examples:
- **Lending application** that allows users to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets with a variable or stable interest rate.
- **Liquid staking** a liquid staking provider takes token deposits, stakes those tokens, and gives the depositor a receipt which is redeemable for the staked tokens.
- **Aggregator** that unites separate decentralized protocols and aggregates liquidity from a variety of decentralized exchanges to facilitate cost-efficient transactions.

**Technical Showcase**

This category involes the development of applications which demonstrate the advantages of ink! over other smart contract languages (e.g. Solidity).

The case doesn't necessarily need to be business oriented, but it should showcase ink!'s unique strengths.

You can use following aspects as indicators:
- efficient gas usage
- decreased smart contract size
- improved developer experience
- improved debugging experience

**Infrastructure**

The goal of this track is to improve the ink! ecosystem's developer infrastructure and tooling. We welcome you to be innovative and submit your ideas. We will prefer ideas that add differentiation to the Polkadot/ink! ecosystem, rather than tools that simply duplicate EVM.

Examples of successful infrastructure products:
- [OpenBrush](https://openbrush.io/)
- [Swanky](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/swanky-cli)

### Support

The scope of our Grant Program consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources. You can find general documentation and more information on ink! on the [use.ink](https://use.ink/) website.

Also, you can visit community support channels:
- [Smart contract & Parity's ink! Element](https://matrix.to/#/#ink:matrix.parity.io)
- [Brushfam ink! community Discord](https://discord.gg/9FRETSPmp9)

## :pencil: Process

> **:loudspeaker:** Payment is made in DOT (on Polkadot).

### 1. Application
   1. [Fork](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty/Wasm-Bounty-01/fork) this repository.
   2. In the newly created fork, create a copy of the application template ([`applications/application-template.md`](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty/Ecosystem-Grants/blob/master/applications/application-template.md)). 
   3. Name the new file after your project: `project_name.md`.
   4. Fill out the template with the details of your project. The more information you provide, the faster the review. Make sure your deliverables present a similar level of detail.
   5. Once you're done, create a pull request in **this repozitory**. The pull request should only contain _one new file_ — the Markdown file you created from the template.

### 2. Application Review

   1. Curators can (and usually do) issue comments and request changes on the pull request.
   2. Clarifications and amendments made in the comments _need to be included in the application_. You may address feedback by directly modifying your application and leaving a comment once you're done. Generally, if you don't reply within 2 weeks, the application will be closed due to inactivity, but you're always free to reopen it as long as it hasn't been rejected.
   3. When all requested changes are addressed, someone will mark your application as `ready for review` and share it internally with the rest of the committee.
   4. The application will be accepted and merged as soon as it receives **3 approvals**, or closed after two weeks of inactivity. Unless specified otherwise, the day on which it is accepted will be considered the starting date of the project, and will be used to estimate delivery dates.

### 3. Milestone Delivery and Payment

   Milestones are to be delivered on the [Grant Milestone Delivery](https://github.com/smart-contract-bounty/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) repository following the process described therein.

### Changes to a Grant after Approval

- Accepted grant applications can be amended at any time. However, this _necessitates a curators reevaluation_ and the same number of approvals as an application. If your application has been accepted and, during development, you find that your project significantly deviates from the original specification, please open a new pull request that modifies the existing application. This also applies in case of significant delays.
- If your _delivery schedule_ significantly changes, please also open a pull request with an updated timeline.
- If your deliveries are significantly delayed and we cannot get a hold of you, we will terminate the grant (4 approvals required. If Curator creates the termination PR, only 3 more approvals are required).
