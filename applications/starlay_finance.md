## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

This project demonstrates the Starlay team's dedication to advancing the DeFi space by developing a WebAssembly (Wasm) version of Compound V2, which bolsters both its performance and security capabilities. By making the project's source code open and accessible, we aim to empower developers within the Polkadot ecosystem to seamlessly and securely integrate lending-related functionalities using Wasm technology. This Wasm lending contract is designed to be compatible with all Wasm-supporting parachains, including prominent networks such as Astar Network, Phala Network, Alpha zero, and more.　


### Project Details

As we develop the WebAssembly version of Compound V2, we seek grant funding to support the implementation of a robust lending platform with powerful capabilities similar to those of Compound V2. By obtaining grant for the Wasm implementation of Compound V2, we aim to provide the following key features within the Polkadot ecosystem:

- Deposit: Users can deposit their preferred listed assets, receive lTokens (similar to Compound's cTokens), and earn lending fee income from the interest generated by borrowers.
- Redeem: Users can withdraw their deposited assets and any accrued interest by redeeming their lTokens.
- Borrow: Users can borrow assets at competitive interest rates by providing their assets as collateral, creating a seamless borrowing experience.
- Repay: Borrowers can use this feature to repay their loans, either partially or in full, helping them manage their debt effectively.
- Liquidate: In the event of an undercollateralized loan, users can participate in liquidations, partially repaying the loan and receiving a portion of the collateral in return.
- Flash Loan: Developers can take advantage of flash loans, which allow them to borrow all available assets without collateral, as long as they borrow and repay within a single transaction. This feature enables innovative use cases like arbitrage, refinancing, and liquidations.
