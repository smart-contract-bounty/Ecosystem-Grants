## Project Overview ðŸ“„

  

### Overview

  

Ink! ecosystem is quickly growing thanks to a huge number of marvelous dApp builders that choose Ink! over Solidity because of its security, transparency and easability of use. Each new dApp brings in new users into the ecosystem, creating demand for the underlying native L1 coin which eventually translates into the ecosystem growth.

  

dApp builders currently lack an out-of-the-box solution that would allow them to discover dApp Marvels. What are these? Marvels are data-driven insights concerning the growth of each respective dApp. Whether it's a discovery of power users segment, correlation between two important metrics or understanding which marketing campaign works best - we call them Marvels as they're precious to each dApp owner ðŸ’Ž

  

Tokenguard team would therefore like to propose creation of:

  

#### **Ink! dApp Marvels analytics**

  

We propose creation of a standalone tool that will allow dApp creators & analytical tools index data coming from their smart contracts, aggregate them in a predefined human-readable format and and serve them in plot-ready format directly to your frontend. Such tool is going to run a number of steps to make the Marvel ðŸ’Ž discovery easy and fun for dApp creators.

  

1. After smart contract deployment, dApp creator runs the Ink! dApp Marvels analytics by uploading contracts' ABIs.
2. The ABIs are decoded and translated into SubSquid powered data processor with smart contract decoder.
3. Using the API interface dApp creator specifies potential dApp Marvels that should be tracked - this can be an event with its respective arguments (or any mixture of both). Marvels can include actions invoked in more than 1 smart contract.
4. Aggregated database of Marvels is created and automatically populated in case any of these events happen on-chain.
5. dApp creator can query the database using API or display the data in a human-readable format using JSONs that can be then plotted on the frontend of your app.

  

The solution can be used as a standalone tool or parsed by data analytics tools available in the space such as Grafana, Tokenguard, Databox and others. Thanks to the API, dApp creators will be able to display their dApp data actively on websites to increase transparency for users.

  

### Substrate Ecosystem Impact

  

In order to facilitate growth, Substrate parachains need a vast and thriving environment of developers creating dApps and smart contracts. Each smart contract generates thousands of transactions that store important technical and business insights. Each new growing dApp, with its own marketing & growth strategy, **brings in new active users to the ecosystem**. These insights are currently hard to discover and the ecosystem needs infrastructure tools that would make it easy for developers and management teams to uncover them, similarly as it is done in EVM environment with tools like Tenderly or Dune Analytics.

  

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

  

Most of the Ink! teams that we spoke with **are wasting hundreds of hours and thousands of $** to build their own data displaying solutions and maintain them which effectively defocuses them from building and developing user-centric features. Most of these solutions are hard to maintain and manage, increasing the technological debt of each project.

  

Benefits of the proposed solution:

  

*   Allowing Ink! dApp builders to focus on **developing their products**
*   **Time and money savings** on data tracking and visualisation \[Building in-house data-analytics = ~$30k - $70k\]
*   Higher security of dApps as the tool can be used for tracking **security metrics**
*   **dApp transparency** to ecosystem managers and Substrate community
*   Smaller maintenance cost and technological debt
*   **Faster growth of Ink! dApps**
