## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Enhancing the user experience by integrating light clients as an alternative option for connecting to a Substrate node instead of relying solely on third-party RPC nodes. Related issue: https://github.com/paritytech/useink/issues/40
- I am excited to work on this project because I believe in the potential of light clients to revolutionize how users interact with Substrate-based blockchains. By developing user-friendly tools that streamline the development of application-specific light clients, I hope to contribute to the growth of the Substrate ecosystem and help drive the adoption of decentralized solutions that are more secure, scalable, and accessible.

| 0b.    | Documentation                   | I will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how to use light clients to connect to a Substrate node.                                           |
| 0c.    | Testing and Testing Guide       | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit or smoke tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, I will describe how to run these tests.                    |
| 1.     | Light clients as an alternative | I propose to implement light clients as an alternative method of connecting to a Substrate node, alongside the existing option to use third-party RPC nodes.                               |
| 2.     | Use cases                       | I will provide a detailed description of use cases for light clients. I will also add a working example in a sandbox dApp such as this one: https://github.com/nicolad/useink-kitchen-sink |
