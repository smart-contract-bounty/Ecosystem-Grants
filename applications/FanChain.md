### Overview

FanChain is dedicated to empowering streamers, influencers, and their communities by providing a platform for NFT creation, trading, and community management. By leveraging the power of ink! smart contracts and the Polkadot ecosystem, we aim to create a seamless and secure experience for content creators and their fans.

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact

By providing a user-friendly platform for creators to issue NFTs and manage their communities, FanChain will attract more users to the ink! ecosystem and demonstrate its versatility.

Fans can purchase these NFTs on our marketplace and participate in exclusive community events on Discord and Telegram. Additionally, FanChain offers a crypto-based donation system for viewers to support their favorite creators.
- NFT Creation: Streamers and influencers can create and issue NFT collections, including generative and membership NFTs, using ink! smart contracts.
- Marketplace: Users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs on our platform, fostering a vibrant and active community around content creators and their fans.

- Crypto Donations: Viewers can support their favorite creators by donating cryptocurrency, with donation information displayed during live streams.
- Compatibility: FanChain will be compatible with all Wasm-supporting parachains, including prominent networks such as Astar Network, Phala Network, and more.

Technology Stack: FanChain will be built using ink! for smart contracts for the underlying blockchain, and a combination of React and Node.js for the frontend and backend.
