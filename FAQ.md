## What is the application process?

Curators will review your application and reply within two weeks of submission. *Ecosystem Grant* applications must be submitted via Pull Requests in this repo. Curators will often leave initial feedback in your PRs and ask for more clarity or other changes. You must receive at least 4 approvals from Curators to be accepted. If your application is rejected then you will be notified via GitHub. *Builder Track* and *Auditor Track* applications will be reviewed internally so that we can respect sensitive information about business ideas and plans. These application results will be given via email. If you are accepted then you will receive follow up information through Element.
